# code-quiz
This project creates a timed quiz.The first screen the user sees includes the header and a start button. Once the start button is clicked, a timer starting at 75 seconds begins countdown and the first question and set of answers is displayed. If the user guesses the answer correctly, a point is added to their score. If the userguesses incorrectly, 5 seconds are subtracted from the timer. Another question is displayed once the first question is answered. If the timer runs out before the user can complete the quiz, the quiz will end. At the end of the quiz, the userd score is displayed and they are able to store their initials with their score.
